A technique in which a websites design is automatically adjusted based on the size of the users screens.

Pros
- Only need one website (no need for mobile version of the website)
- Images and text use all the available space
- Positive impact on your websites SEO
- Ensures you deliver to all users

Cons
- Scales the size of the element which changes the design/layout of the website
- Images are visually scaled down, so smaller devices have a longer loading time
- Important features could be overlooked due to the alignment of elements on smaller screens
