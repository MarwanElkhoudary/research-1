# Adding to this repo

Use the normal [GitHub workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to add your files to this repo

On research day:
1. Add a new folder to this repo with the appropriate name: `week-1`, `week-2`, etc.

2. Add your markdown file and update the README.md with a link.  
_Do not merge a pull request if the README.md is not updated accordingly :wink:_


### Week 1
**Command line and Git & GitHub:**  
If you add to the existing file in `week-1`, you won't have to alter the `README.md` - these files have already been linked for you.

**Accessibility and CSS:**  
Replace each "`link-to-published-site`" and "`link-to-commit`" with:
+ **Chosen website** - the _hosted_ version of the website you have chosen to work on

+ **Before** - the github repo for this website _as it was on the commit before changes were made_

+ **After** - the github repo _as it was on the commit after changes were made_

Note: Check [below](#commit-history) if you're not sure how to link to a particular commit in your history.

### Week 2
Add a `week-2` folder with your markdown files and update the links in the README.md, if necessary.

### Week 3 +
Follow the structure used for week 2 in the readme

Add the bullet points from the relevant `research-afternoon.md` in the [master-reference repo](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference)
