# Technical spikes

> **If we knew what we were doing it wouldn't be called research.**

### What are technical spikes?
A way of learning the scale of future problems. It is a bare minimum of code to estimate what may need to be written in the future. This means the spike code is generally thrown out because it does not serve the goals of the spring rather it helps to estimate the length and type of work in upcoming sprints.

### When and why would a spike be useful?
+ Mitigate future risks
+ Familiarise team with new hardware/software
+ Gather information so as to understand a functional/technical problem

### How would you successfully spike on a topic?
+ Set a time limit for research
+ Split areas of research so have coverage and get good idea of future problems
+ Discuss findings and decide on new course of action

### Give an example of how a spike could have helped with last week's projects.
+ Mobile first?
